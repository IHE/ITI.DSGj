# Introduction to This Supplement

## Problem Statement

This profile is motivated by customer requirements for Document Digital Signatures (DSG) to use signing technology using JSON encoding vs the XML-Signature currently supported in DSG profile.

# Open Issues and Questions

1. [Notes about deviation from profile are not being stated in the DSGj profile.](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.DSGj/issues/13)
2. [The usage of DSGj with MHD(ITI-105) is not covered by the DSGj chapter.](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.DSGj/issues/14)
3. [DSGj does not contain guidance around homeCommunityID](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.DSGj/issues/15)
4. [Will add examples after Public-Comment](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.DSGj/issues/19) 

# Closed Issues

- Will update the XML-Signature content module using a CP as some more clear descriptions have been written for the JSON Signature content module that would benefit the XML-Signature content module. These are not breaking changes.
