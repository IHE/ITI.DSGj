      <p>Document Digital Signature content shall conform to JAdES schema for signatures, with extensions and restrictions defined in the following. IHE is not changing any optionality, prohibiting use of options, or mandating options. Issues such as long-term archival management of certificates are out of scope of this profile.</p>

      <p>The following constraints define the <mark>Digital Signature</mark> block. This block is common to the detached signature and Enveloping signature.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Shall conform to JAdES-B-LT – for support of Long Term signatures. The JAdES-B-LT specification adds the timestamp of the signing and inclusion of the certificate and statement of revocation.</li>

      JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of representing content secured with digital signatures or Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) using JSON data structures. Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers used with this specification are enumerated in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA). <sup id="fnref:fourth"><a href="#fn:fourth" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

            <li>The signature is a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F">Detached</a> Signature (where the content that is signed is removed from the JWS)</li>
            <li>When FHIR Resources are signed, the signature is across the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/json.html#canonical">Canonical JSON</a> form of the resource(s)</li>

For example, some environments may choose a different XAdES profile, hashing algorithm, policy identifier, or signature purpose vocabulary.

Content Consumers can validate these Digital Signature blocks, and be capable of configured behavior according to the local policy.</mark></span>

      <h3 id="5.10.3">5.10.3 JSON Detached Signature</h3>
      <p>The Detached Signature utilizes the XML Signature - Reference element (ds:reference) to identify and provide a hash for each document that is signed. This set of Reference elements is considered the manifest. The URI attribute shall be used and hold the document uniqueID. For documents that do not use a URI as the uniqueId, the Affinity Domain should determine an appropriate way to encode the DocumentEntry.uniqueId.</p>
      <h4 id="5.10.3.1">5.10.3.1 JSON SubmissionSet Signature</h4>
      <p>The SubmissionSet Signature is a variant of the Detached Signature used to digitally sign a complete SubmissionSet. The signature can later be validated to assure that the SubmissionSet is complete and the same as when it was created.</p>
      <p>The SubmissionSet Signature shall be a Detached Signature that has Reference elements for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">the SubmissionSet uniqueID with a hash value of “0”</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">the document uniqueID for each of the documents contained in the SubmissionSet not including the SubmissionSet Signature document</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The SubmissionSet Signature creation is informatively described here with the Content Creator grouped with an XDS Document Source and is equally applicable with grouping the Content Creator with the other Document Sharing infrastructure (e.g., XDR, and XDM). The document publication transaction is not specific to the SubmissionSet Signature process or content, and is included here only to show overall workflow.</p>
      <p>Informative process for creating a SubmissionSet Signature:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="numbered-list1">A set (n) of Documents of interest are gathered, or generated to be published</li>
        <li class="numbered-list1">A SubmissionSet is created for the Documents, for example in preparation for using the Provide and Register Document Set-b [ITI-41] transaction or equivalent</li>
        <li class="numbered-list1">A Digital Signature document is created which includes Reference elements of:</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li class="numbered-list2">The SubmissionSet.uniqueId is included in the manifest, with a zero hash value (the value “0”).</li>
        <li class="numbered-list2">All of the (n) documents to be included in the SubmissionSet, other than the signature document, are listed in the manifest with their hash.</li>
        <li class="numbered-list2">The signature document is processed according to Section 5.10.2, and thus signed.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="4">
        <li class="numbered-list1">The signature document would be added to the SubmissionSet according to Section 5.10.6. The SubmissionSet may, but is not required, include all the “SIGNS” association defined in Section 5.10.6.4 with associations to all the other documents in the SubmissionSet. The “SIGNS” association is redundant in this case as the SubmissionSet already groups these documents.</li>
        <li class="numbered-list1">The SubmissionSet with the (n) documents and the Digital Signature document is submitted using the Provide and Register Document Set-b [ITI-41] transaction, or equivalent from the other Document Sharing infrastructures.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="5.10.4">5.10.4 JSON Enveloping Signature</h3>
      <p>The Enveloping Signature utilizes the XML Signature – “Include” capability where the full content of the signed document is encoded inside the signature document in the Object element (ds:object).</p>
      <p>The signed document shall be base64 encoded, unless some other policy overrides.</p>
      <p>The object element Encoding shall be specified (http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64).</p>
      <h3 id="5.10.5">5.10.5 JSON Signature Verification</h3>
      <p>There are three levels of signature verification:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="numbered-list1">verifying that the Digital Signature block itself has integrity through verifying the signature across the XML-Signature,</li>
        <li class="numbered-list1">confirming that the signer was authentic, not revoked, and appropriate to the signature purpose,</li>
        <li class="numbered-list1">confirming that the signed Documents of interest are unmodified using the hash algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Content Consumer shall verify the Digital Signature block has integrity.</p>
      <p>The Content Consumer shall be able to be configured with local policy on PKI trust models, and management that supports the confirmation that the signer was authentic, not revoked, and appropriate to the signature purpose. The Content Consumer shall use this configuration when confirming the validity of the signature.</p>
      <p>The Content Consumer shall be able to confirm the validity of the documents that are signed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Workflow or local policy may direct that all or a subset of the signed documents be validated. There are use cases where only one document within a signed set of documents is all that is called for by the workflow.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Workflow or local policy may direct that all or a subset of the signatures found within a Digital Signature Document be validated. The Digital Signature Document may contain signatures for purposes that are not relevant to the Content Consumer purpose that may not be possible to fully validate. A Content Consumer should silently ignore signatures that are not necessary to the purpose of the Content Consumer. For example, a signature may be from a different organization.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">The document may not be accessible to the user, for example authorization denied, so confirmation of valid signed content may be impossible.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">If there is a SubmissionSet unique ID included in the manifest, then the Content Consumer shall be able to verify that the submission set reference in the manifest is the one containing the documents which are listed in the manifest and the documents listed in the manifest are the complete list of documents in the submission set on the XDS Registry.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The decision on what degree of verification is needed is determined by the application and use case.</p>
      <p>The Content Consumer shall be able to validate content that uses SHA256 as well as SHA1.</p>
      <h3 id="5.10.6">5.10.6 JSON Document Sharing Metadata</h3>
